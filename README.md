# NLP project for identifying fake and true news

Given a sample of fake news and true news, i.e. paragraphs of text and the label associated with them, can we learn to predict or judge whether a piece of news is fake or true?

This project aims at building NLP classification model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Keras for identifying fake news and true/real news. The data sets are obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset
